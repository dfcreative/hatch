A better painter than you.

Mathematicians would say that is [SDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation), painters would say that is a scribble, mystics would say that is life (indeed just Math.random properly applied).

I just want it to produce hatching or patterns, but it appears to be a natural drawing technique by itself.

TODO:

* hatching
* patterns
* tree paint
* ink
* river
* painter style
